# The Cardano Blockchain Needs A Decentralized Node Discovery Service

The Cardano blockchain does not yet have a production ready p2p feature to update topology files,
although all required information is registered in the blockchain.

To find a temporary workaround, the Cardano community created a centralized API (known as CLIO1, api.clio.one) to
exchange node's IP addresses and update their topology files.

The `cardano-p2p` application solves this issue and enables fully decentralized
topology file updates.

## How It Works

The `cardano-p2p` application:
* Connects to [Ogmios](https://ogmios.dev/) websocket in order to get registered pool parameters found in the Cardano blockchain
* Verifies each pool metadata and sends a TCP probe to ensure their IP and port are still reachable
* Selects Cardano nodes that passed the above test in order to produce valid topology files
* Serves list of Cardano nodes randomly to ensure *fairness* and produce *reliable* Graphs topologies

## Backward Compatibility

`cardano-p2p` implements an API that is backward compatible with CLIO hosted service api.clio.one
and therefore is designed to simplify the transition.
