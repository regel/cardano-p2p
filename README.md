# The Cardano Blockchain Needs A Decentralized Node Discovery Service

The Cardano blockchain does not have a p2p feature to update topology files,
although all required information is registered in the blockchain.

To workaround this limitation, the Cardano community created a centralized API to
exchange node's IP addresses and update their topology files.

The `cardano-p2p` application solves this issue and enables fully decentralized
topology file updates.

## How It Works

The `cardano-p2p` application:
* Reads registered pool metadata in the Cardano blockchain (testnet and mainnet)
* Vets the data and ensures the IP and port are reachable
* Selects valid Cardano node relays to produce valid topology files
* Selects valid nodes randomly to ensure *fairness* and produce *reliable* Graphs topologies

## Backward Compatibility

`cardano-p2p` implements an API that is backward compatible with CLIO hosted service api.clio.one
and therefore is designed to simplify the transition.
